### README ###

The GAPfiller GSM900 version 3.0 board is a RF front end daughtercard intended for a single TRX GSM basestation in the 900 MHz band.  The GAPfiller GSM900 is compatible with the [Ettus Research](https://www.ettus.com/product) USRP software-defined radio systems. 

Modifications to the USRP FPGA and UHD are necessary to run OpenBTS or osmo-bts on the GAPfiller board.  As this work is completed, these modifications will be added to this repository on Github.
